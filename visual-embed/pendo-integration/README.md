# Pendo Integration with ThoughtSpot Embed

## ðŸ§© Overview

This project contains a code example for embedded ThoughtSpot developers who are integrating Pendo with a ThoughtSpot Embed instance using the **Third-Party-Tools-For-Embed** feature.  
[Reference: https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/external-tool-script-integration]

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

This project uses the **Third-Party-Tools-For-Embed** feature, which is **not enabled by default** on your ThoughtSpot cluster.

To enable this feature, please contact ThoughtSpot Support and provide the necessary details.

**Enablement Steps:**

1. Host your integration script on a **publicly accessible URL** that serves JavaScript. (In this example, the hosted script is `pendoIntegrationScript.js`.)
2. Share the hosted script URL with ThoughtSpot Support so they can configure it for your cluster. Be sure to share the **full path of the URL including the `.js` file**.
3. A user with **Admin privileges** needs to go to the **Develop > Security Settings** page in the ThoughtSpot application.
4. Enable the feature by editing the `CSPScriptSrc` field. Also, ensure that the domain where your script is hosted is whitelisted.

ðŸ“˜ For step-by-step enablement instructions, refer to the documentation:  
https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/external-tool-script-integration

Once the feature is enabled and your script is configured, you can embed your ThoughtSpot instance as usual. The hosted script will automatically execute inside the ThoughtSpot ecosystem after authentication completes. Be sure to pass the correct variables in the `init()` configuration for the script to execute properly.

You can then configure your Pendo guides through the Pendo dashboard. Once configured, the guides will appear inside the embedded ThoughtSpot instance.
