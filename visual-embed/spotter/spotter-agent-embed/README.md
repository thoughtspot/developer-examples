# spotter-agent-embed

This is a small example of how embed spotter into your own agent if you have one. The example creates a simple agent using Gemini-flash model's function calling capability.

The simple agent makes the decision whether a user's message has analytical intent and should be handled by ThoughtSpot. The decision is passed down to the client which makes
the actual API call to run the query on ThoughtSpot and return the ThoughtSpot visual using the ThoughtSpot Visual embed SDK.
