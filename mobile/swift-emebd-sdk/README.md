## Overview

The Swift Embed SDK Demo App demonstrates how to:

- Authenticate with a ThoughtSpot instance
- Embed a ThoughtSpot Liveboard in a SwiftUI application
- Handle events from the embedded content
- Customize the appearance of the embedded content
- Trigger actions on the embedded content

This sandbox provides a complete, working example that you can use as a reference or starting point for your own implementations.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode 13.0+
- iOS 14.0+
- Swift 5.5+
- A ThoughtSpot account with:
  - Access to a ThoughtSpot instance
  - A Liveboard to embed
  - Valid user credentials or secret key

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thoughtspot/developer-examples.git
cd developer-examples/swift-embed-sdk-demo
```

### Open the Project in Xcode

```bash
open Swift-Embed-SDK-Demo.xcodeproj
```

If the above command doesn't work, you can manually open Xcode and select "Open..." from the File menu, then navigate to the cloned repository and select the project file.

### Configure the Demo App

1. No configuration is needed to run the demo app as-is. Simply build and run the project in the iOS Simulator or on a physical device.

2. When the app starts, you'll see a login screen where you'll need to provide:
   - Username: Your ThoughtSpot username
   - ThoughtSpot Host: The URL of your ThoughtSpot instance (e.g., `https://your-instance.thoughtspot.cloud`)
   - Secret Key or Password: Your authentication credentials
   - Liveboard ID: The ID of the Liveboard you want to embed

### Run the Demo App

1. Select an iOS Simulator or connect an iOS device to your Mac
2. Click the Run button in Xcode or press âŒ˜R

## Implementation Details

### Setting Up the Embed Configuration

The demo app showcases the proper way to configure and initialize the SDK:

```swift
// 1. Create custom styling (optional)
let cssVariablesDict: [String: String] = [
    "--ts-var-root-background": "#fef4dd",
    "--ts-var-root-color": "#4a4a4a",
    "--ts-var-viz-title-color": "#8e6b23",
    // More custom styles...
]

let customCSSObject = customCssInterface(variables: cssVariablesDict)
let styleObject = CustomStyles(customCSS: customCSSObject)
let customizationsObject = CustomisationsInterface(style: styleObject)

// 2. Create the static embed configuration
let staticEmbedConfig = EmbedConfig(
    thoughtSpotHost: thoughtSpotHost,
    authType: AuthType.TrustedAuthTokenCookieless,
    customizations: customizationsObject
)

// 3. Create a token provider function using Combine
func getAuthToken() -> Future<String, Error> {
    Future { promise in
        Task {
            if let token = await fetchAuthToken(username: username, secretKey: secretKey, host: thoughtSpotHost) {
                promise(.success(token))
            } else {
                promise(.failure(NSError(
                    domain: "AuthError", code: 1,
                    userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Failed to fetch auth token"]
                )))
            }
        }
    }
}

// 4. Create the TSEmbedConfig with the token provider
let tsEmbedConfig = TSEmbedConfig(
    embedConfig: staticEmbedConfig,
    getAuthToken: getAuthToken
)

// 5. Create the Liveboard view configuration
let liveboardViewConfig = LiveboardViewConfig(
    liveboardId: liveboardId
)

// 6. Create the LiveboardEmbedController
let liveboardController = LiveboardEmbedController(
    tsEmbedConfig: tsEmbedConfig,
    viewConfig: liveboardViewConfig
)
```

### Using the LiveboardEmbed SwiftUI Component

The demo shows how to use the LiveboardEmbed component with the controller:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var liveboardController: LiveboardEmbedController
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Embed the Liveboard using the LiveboardEmbed component
            LiveboardEmbed(controller: liveboardController)
                .frame(height: 600)
                .cornerRadius(12)
                .onAppear {
                    // Register event listeners when the component appears
                    registerEventListeners()
                }
            
            // Add custom UI controls
            HStack {
                Button {
                    // Trigger a host event on the embedded content
                    liveboardController.trigger(event: HostEvent.Reload)
                } label: {
                    Image(systemName: "arrow.clockwise")
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Register for events from the embedded content
    func registerEventListeners() {
        liveboardController.on(event: EmbedEvent.AuthInit) { payload in
            print("Authentication initialized")
        }
        
        liveboardController.on(event: EmbedEvent.LiveboardRendered) { payload in
            print("Liveboard rendered")
        }
    }
}
```

## Features

### Authentication

The demo app supports two authentication methods:
- Secret Key authentication (recommended)
- Username/password authentication

### Liveboard Embedding

The app demonstrates how to:
- Initialize the SDK with proper configuration
- Create and configure a LiveboardEmbedController
- Embed a ThoughtSpot Liveboard using the LiveboardEmbed SwiftUI component

### Event Handling

The demo shows how to:
- Register for events from the embedded content
- Handle events such as authentication initialization, Liveboard rendering, and errors
- Respond to user interactions with the embedded content

### Host Actions

The demo demonstrates how to trigger actions on the embedded content:
- Reload the Liveboard
- Open the Share dialog

### Custom Styling

The demo shows how to customize the appearance of the embedded content using:
- Custom CSS variables
- Custom fonts and colors
- Custom styles for UI elements

## Authentication Flow

The demo app implements a complete authentication flow:

1. User enters credentials on the login screen
2. Credentials are validated
3. A token is fetched from the ThoughtSpot API
4. The token is used to authenticate the embedded content
5. The user is shown the embedded Liveboard upon successful authentication

## Customization

### Styling the Embedded Content

The demo shows how to customize the appearance of the embedded ThoughtSpot content:

```swift
let cssVariablesDict: [String: String] = [
    "--ts-var-root-background": "#fef4dd",
    "--ts-var-root-color": "#4a4a4a",
    "--ts-var-viz-title-color": "#8e6b23",
    // More customizations...
]

let customCSSObject = customCssInterface(variables: cssVariablesDict)
let styleObject = CustomStyles(customCSS: customCSSObject)
let customizationsObject = CustomisationsInterface(style: styleObject)
```

### Custom UI Elements

The demo includes custom styled buttons and UI elements:

```swift
Button {
    liveboardController.trigger(event: HostEvent.Reload)
} label: {
    Image(systemName: "arrow.clockwise")
        .foregroundColor(.white)
}
.buttonStyle(StyledButton())
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Ensure your ThoughtSpot host URL includes the protocol (https://)
   - Verify that your credentials are correct
   - Check that your secret key is valid and active

2. **Liveboard Not Loading**
   - Ensure the Liveboard ID is correct
   - Check that your user has access to the Liveboard
   - Look for errors in the Xcode console using the Error event listener

3. **Network Issues**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure your ThoughtSpot instance is accessible
   - Check that App Transport Security settings allow connection to your host

### Debugging Tips

The demo app includes comprehensive error handling and logging:

```swift
liveboardController.on(event: EmbedEvent.Error) { payload in
    print(">>> HomeView: Received Error. Payload: \(payload ?? "nil")")
}
```
