# WARNING: Using a static bearer token (VITE_TS_AUTH_TOKEN) is for development
# and demo purposes only. Do NOT use this approach in production. For production
# deployments, implement the full Trusted Authentication flow where your backend
# securely generates short-lived tokens on behalf of each user.
# See: https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/trusted-auth
